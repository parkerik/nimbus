# Nimbus

Nimbus is a web app with the intention of being a home server to store images and videos. You can spin up each service separately or together with Docker. You will need to create a .env file with the directory to where you want files saved. A good default is /usr/nimbus/documents/images.

### Run with Docker

```
$ docker compose up
```
